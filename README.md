# First Java and Excel Project

### Tech Stack: Java, Microsoft Excel, Word Document

This project was completed as part of the CSE1341 course at Southern Methodist University. It involves:
- Writing and running a simple Java program.
- Identifying syntax errors in Java.
- Using Microsoft Excel to solve basic financial and geometric problems.

## Project Overview

### Part 1: Java First Program
- **File**: `FirstProgram.java`
- This is a simple introductory Java program aimed at verifying the Java Development Kit (JDK) installation.
- We explored basic syntax by intentionally creating and correcting an error.

### Part 2: Productivity Software (Excel Analysis)
1. **Salary Comparison**:
   - Compared a salaried position at $80,000/year to an hourly contractor position at $70/hour.
   - Considered factors like **medical benefits**, **paid holidays**, and **vacation days**.
   - The Excel file (**Salary_Comparison.xlsx**) allows users to input different parameters and see how the income changes.

2. **Salary Growth Over Time**:
   - Modeled salary growth for an employee earning $30,000/year with an annual raise starting at 5.1%, reducing each year by 0.1%.
   - The file (**Salary_Growth.xlsx**) calculates the annual salary and total earnings over a decade.

3. **Geometric Area Calculations**:
   - Calculated areas for different shapes:
     - **Square**: Based on one side length.
     - **Rectangle**: Based on length and width.
     - **Triangle**: Based on base and height.
     - **Circle**: Using radius.
   - The file (**Area_Calculations.xlsx**) allows users to input values and see the calculated area.

## How to Run the Java Code
- To run the Java program, you can compile and execute it as follows:
  ```bash
  javac FirstProgram.java
  java FirstProgram
  ```
